//! STM32L4 HAL implementation
//!
//! NOTE: This HAL implementation is under active development (as is the underlying
//! `embedded_hal` itself, together with its traits, some of which are unproven).
//! We follow the HAL implementation in <https://github.com/therealprof/stm32f4xx-hal>
//! and pull in individual devices behind features - the goal is for this implementation
//! to become ubiquitous for the STM32L4 family of devices (well-tested, feature-complete,
//! well-documented). However! At this time, actual testing has only been performed for
//! the STM32L432KC microcontroller. Participation is of course very welcome!
